This script counts the number of GitLab events from certain users within a certain period of time.

It is particularly suitable for evaluating useless KPIs at the end of the year within a team. ðŸ˜‰

## Setup
To run this script, you need to add an access token with the "read_user" permission in your GitLab user settings and save it with other parameters in env.py file. See env.py for more information or just take a look in the simple script code.
